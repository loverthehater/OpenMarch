# OpenMarch

I'm learning about software design/development as I'm going along. I just thought this would be a fun project. As I'm learning and want to carry this project onto separate machines and "save progress" as I do so, I'll be saving things regarding to my own personal progress in the folder "plan".

## Building

Currently, there's not much to build, but I'm planning on creating a main CMakeLists.txt in the main project directory. All there is right now is a `CMakeLists.txt` in the `src` directory. Doing `cmake src` would be all that there is to do for now.
